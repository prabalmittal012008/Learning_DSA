/* Q5: A system receives two separate logs of user arrival times from two different servers. Each log is already sorted in ascending order. Your task is to create a single chronological log that preserves the correct order of arrivals.

Input:
- First line: integer p (number of entries in server log 1)
- Second line: p sorted integers representing arrival times from server 1
- Third line: integer q (number of entries in server log 2)
- Fourth line: q sorted integers representing arrival times from server 2)

Output:
- Print a single line containing all arrival times in chronological order, separated by spaces

Example:
Input:
5
10 20 30 50 70
4
15 25 40 60

Output:
10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70

Explanation: Compare the next unprocessed arrival time from both logs and append the earlier one to the final log until all entries are processed */
